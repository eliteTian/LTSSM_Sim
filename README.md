Project Name:
    PCIe LTSSM module

Description:
    This project is using verilog to implement PCIe LTSSM, aimed at getting 
    familiarized with the Link training process. The core of the LTSSM are 
    implemented using synthesizable RTL, other blocks that facilitate SIM can
    use non-synthesizable simulation model.
    The phases/milestones can grow as development is ongoing.
    Current simulation tool is Vivado built-in simulation tool.
